# OpenMP Practice
OpenMP code located in C++ folder. 
All OpenMP calculations are written in .csv and store in data folder. 
In Jupyter Notebooks you'll find the short conclusion [RUS]. 
And myplots.py needs to visualize plots. 
## Tasks
1. *[minmax.ipynb](https://github.com/Mooncake911/OpenMP_Practice/blob/master/minmax.ipynb)* - searching for Min/Max in vector.  
2. *[scalar.ipynb](https://github.com/Mooncake911/OpenMP_Practice/blob/master/scalar.ipynb)* - calculating scalar product.
3. *[scalar2.ipynb](https://github.com/Mooncake911/OpenMP_Practice/blob/master/scalar2.ipynb)* - scalar product with filling a vector with random numbers by sections.
4. *[matrix.ipynb](https://github.com/Mooncake911/OpenMP_Practice/blob/master/matrix.ipynb)* - searching for Max value from Min values in each raw of matrix.
5. *[matrix2.ipynb](https://github.com/Mooncake911/OpenMP_Practice/blob/master/matrix2.ipynb)* - the same as 4, but with uneven compute load with triangle matrix.
6. *[Numerical-Integration](https://github.com/Mooncake911/Numerical-Integration)* - add repo with —Åalculating the area under curve.
